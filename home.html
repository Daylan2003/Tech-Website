                    Hi ! I am a Computer Engineering Student and a huge tech enthusiast. I made this website to give you accurate, unbiased and up to date information on the latest tech (specifically phones) to help you find which tech device is right for you and so you can make a choice for yourself.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Besides being useful, this website is more-so a passion project. I coded this website using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. In fact, the time of writing this makes it about 1 week since I started learning to code in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Anyway, thanks for reading !    
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-segment">
                <p class="Heading" id="home-about-this-website-heading">
                    About This Website
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As mentioned before, I made this website to give you accurate, unbiased and up to date information on the latest tech. But at the same time, I hope this website can be educational in some this. This is why I’ve created the “Definitions” button in the header of the webpage. There are many technical terms used by companies (specifically phone companies) which the average person will not understand. By clicking the blue links scattered around the articles or even by clicking on the Definitions button, it will take you to a separate web page with a brief description of the term.    
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Additionally, you may notice two other buttons, “phone comparisons” and “more tech articles”.    
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    That's because we can split the website in two main categories. One, obviously is where we compare phone to each other, and the other is where we talk about, rank and even compare random tech gadgets. 
                </p>
